                           CREAMY GARLIC CHICKEN

Original recipe from https://www.saltandlavender.com/creamy-garlic-chicken/
    "This cremay garlic chicken recipe is the ultimate easy comfort food!
     Tender chicken breast smothered in a creamy garlic sauce is 
     irresistible."

It's recommended to make this in a cast-iron, but I'm a college student.
We don't even have mixing bowls. Yesterday I made banana bread batter in
a salad spinner, so the moral of the story is "use what you got."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
@ 2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise
* flour (for dredging)
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 head garlic cloves, peeled
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 1/2 tsp lemon juice
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* parsley (optional)

Serve with:
* Brussels sprouts
* Cauliflower rice
* Sauteed mushrooms

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

If you're going to make brussels sprouts on the side (or some other
roasted veg), you should get those going now. For brussels, preheat oven
to 400 deg. Trim and halve the brussel sprouts, toss with a generous 
amount of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread face down on a baking sheet
and bake for 25 minutes.

Now, for the chicken:
Cut the chicken in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets. 
Sprinkle them with some salt & pepper and coat them in the flour. 

Add the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the butter to a skillet over medium-high 
heat. Once the pan is hot, saut√© the chicken for 4-5 minutes/side or until 
it's nice and golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside.

Reduce the heat to medium (or even med-low if using cast iron), and add the
rest of the butter to the pan. Let it melt and then add the garlic cloves.
Cook them for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until they're lightly browned 
on the outside. 
(NOTE: Do not use garlic paste or crushed garlic. This will not integrate
with the sauce well!)

Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and garlic powder to the pan. Let it 
bubble for around 4 minutes or until the liquid is noticeably reduced.

Stir in the cream and add the chicken back into the pan.
Let it cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce is reduced and the 
chicken is cooked through. Now is a good time to start sauteeing some 
mushrooms.

Serve with freshly chopped parsley if you wish.

Enjoy!
