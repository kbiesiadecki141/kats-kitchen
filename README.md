## Kat's Kitchen

Is there any code here? No. Am I making a git repository for this anyway?
Apparently, yes. I just don't have time to click around my Google Drive
all the time; I'm taking the lazy route (plus my recipes are just text
files anyway). I've shamelessly copied my father's recipe format (as
evidenced by chili-3beer.txt) because it's simple and clean.

# To-Do
* Organize into folders 
* Do something with imhungry.py, which is basically just grep but worse
- i.e. make it useful. or delete it.
* Add quarantine recipes
