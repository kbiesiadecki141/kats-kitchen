                              EGGPLANT PARMESAN

A haiku:

  I am an eggplant
  breading me is too much work
  just stick in oven



(Recipe from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25321/eggplant-parmesan-ii/)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
@ 1 eggplant
@ lotza mozza(rella)
* plenty o' parmesan
@ pasta sauce
* garlic
* sausage
* mushrooms
* basil

Serve with:
* more parmesan
* mark zuccherbinis
* garlic bread 

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

While oven is preheating, slice up your eggplant. Lay out the eggplant
slices onto a tray and salt them (to draw out the moisture). Wait until
you see some water droplets sitting on top of the eggplant, and wipe off
excess with a paper towel. 

While you're waiting for the eggplant to drain, you can elevate your pasta
sauce (if you got it in a jar) with sausage, mushrooms, garlic, basil, etc.
Also, if you're gonna make some zuccs, do it now. You can put 'em in with
the eggplant -- although honestly, the eggparm is filling enough on its own.
Garlic bread is, in the wise words of Hayley Williams, the only exception.

If you're a fancy chef:
    Dip eggplant slices in egg, then in bread crumbs. Place in a single layer 
    on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes on each side.

In a 9x13 inch baking dish spread pasta sauce to cover the bottom. Place 
a layer of eggplant slices in the sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella and 
Parmesan cheeses. Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with the 
cheeses. Sprinkle basil on top.

Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.
