                               EASY CHILI TOFU 
                                    a.k.a.
                                  FOOLS TOFU

This is almost suspiciously easy and delicious. 

I call it Fools Tofu because it's pretty foolproof. Also, due to its 
close resemblance to Mapo Tofu -- without actually *being* mapo tofu --
you'd kinda have to be a fool to serve it to anyone who's had Chinese food
before, because it's definitely not a classy or traditional dish. This is a 
"cheap college kid wants Chinese food" dish.

I would say that on its own, a single person could eat about half a block
of tofu. That's how much I ate without any rice to fill me up along the 
way. All the other ingredients are totally eyeballed, so throw away your
tablespoons and cup measures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
@ soft silken tofu** 
@ Chinese chili oil -- this is basically the entire dish, so it better be
                       a good one!
* soy sauce, to taste
* sesame oil
                       

Serve with:
* green onions
* egg?
* rice
* Asian-y mushrooms could be good idk

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

If you want rice, make it now!

Bring a pot of water to boil. You don't need much -- maybe about 1/3 of the
volume of the silken tofu you're about to use. Err on the side of less
water, since you can't go back once you've added too much.

While the water's coming to a boil, brown some ground pork. Set aside.

Gently add the block of silken tofu to the water and simmer until the tofu 
is warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the tofu.

Dump chili oil, soy sauce, garlic, etc. onto the tofu. Mix. 

Mix in the browned pork, letting it warm up a bit in the tofu before
serving.

That's it! Get a bowl of rice. Top with minced zha cai, scallions,
cilantro, enokis?, sesame seeds, or anything else that convinces you that 
this qualifies as a "dish" and not just a boiled and oiled slab of tofu.
