              SPINACH, TOMATO, AND ITALIAN SAUSAGE PASTA BAKE

A Karen Recipe^TM:

"So I made this recipe on the fly some time during this semester and I
actually don't have any exact measurements for the ingredients. For this 
recipe, I advise using your heart and soul to guide you in determining how 
much of each ingredient to use!"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
* cherry tomatoes, halved
* spinach
* about two Italian sausages, casing removed
* a pound of pasta in whatever shape you like
* a jar of pasta sauce (tomato)
* shredded parmesan
* shredded mozzarella
* oregano
* thyme
* garlic salt
* salt
* black pepper
* cayenne
* olive oil

Serve with:
* garlic bread
* baked veg

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. While that's happening, preheat the 
oven to 400 degrees F. Once the pot reaches a boil, pour in the pound of 
pasta. As soon as the pasta is finished cooking per package instructions, 
drain and rinse with cold water.

Crumble the Italian sausage into bite sized pieces and put it into an 
oiled pan on medium heat. Cook until no longer pink. You don't have to use 
too much oil because the sausage is naturally a lil greasy.

Use the same pot that you used to cook the pasta to heat up the pasta 
sauce. Heat the sauce over medium low heat, stirring in olive oil, oregano, 
thyme, garlic salt, black pepper, and cayenne, until it reaches a simmer. 

Pour the pasta into a 9" x 12" pan. Mix in the cherry tomatoes, the 
spinach, the Italian sausage, and heated pasta sauce. Feel free to mix in 
some of the parmesan and mozzarella here if you want a more even 
distribution of cheese. Otherwise, you can just top the whole mixture with 
a layer of parmesan and mozzarella cheese.

Bake for twenty minutes. Serve immediately.

Enjoy!
