                      REKANELE CHOCOLATE ORANGE CAKE

The COVID-19 Recipe Exchange goes strong. I'll let Karen take it away:

    "This recipe features one of my favorite pairings: chocolate and orange! 
    The great part about this cake is that it's vegan, but it still tastes like 
    actual cake. The recipe I used can be found here. I didn't follow this 
    recipe exactly, though -- as in I didn't make the chocolate topping, and I 
    ended up cooking the whole thing in a loaf pan. My findings from this 
    adventure were that the orange flavor in this cake is pretty strong, so if 
    you're not going to use the chocolate topping, you should probably add an 
    extra tablespoon of cocoa powder. Also, if you bake it in a loaf pan like I
     did, increase that cook time to about forty minutes.

    I also substituted the white vinegar with rice vinegar, since it was the 
    only vinegar I had on hand, and I used olive oil instead of a neutral 
    vegetable oil. It still turned out great, though, so this recipe seems 
    pretty tough to mess up!

    Hopefully this brings you (and Katelyn) some joy in your life! Here's to 
    staying home during quarantine.

    Stay safe and be well,

    Karen Lee"
