                            RAINBOW PAD THAI

Best served with an episode of Futurama.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
 For the pad thai:
 * 4 ounces brown rice noodles (roughly half a box)
 * 1 zucchini
 * 1 red pepper
 * some moyashi bean sprouts
 * half a yellow onion
 * 2 carrots
 * 2 tablespoons oil
 * 1 egg, beaten
 * 1/2 cup peanuts, chopped

 For the sauce:
 * 3 tablespoons fish sauce or vegan fish sauce substitute
 * 3 tablespoons brown sugar (or sub another sweetener)
 * 3 tablespoons chicken or vegetable broth
 * 2 tablespoons white vinegar
 * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
 * 1 teaspoon chili paste (sambal oelek)

Serve with:
* crushed peanuts
* cilantro
* Thai basil
* green onions
* lime

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

Place the uncooked noodles in a bowl of cold water to soak.

Spiralize the zucchini, red pepper, and onion into noodle-like shapes.
Cut the carrots into very small pieces (or spiralize them, too, if theyâ€™re 
big enough).

Shake up the sauce ingredients in a jar.

Heat a tablespoon of oil over medium high heat. Add the veggies - stir fry
with tongs for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Be careful not to overcook
them. Transfer to a dish and set aside.

Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Drain the noodles - they should be
softened by now. Add the noodles to the hot pan and stir fry for a minute, 
using tongs to toss. Add the sauce and stir fry for another minute or two,
until the sauce is starting to thicken and stick to the noodles. Push the
noodles aside to make a little room for the egg. Pour the beaten egg into
the pan and let it sit for 30 seconds or so. Toss everything with tongs.

Add in the vegetables, toss together, and remove from the heat. Stir in
the peanuts and herbs and serve immediately.

Enjoy!
