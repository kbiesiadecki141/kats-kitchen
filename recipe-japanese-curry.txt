Original recipe from https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/
    "Delicious Japanese chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner!
     Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich
     savory curry sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-keep for
     your family meal."

Best served with tsukemono! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
@ 1.2 lb chicken
@ curry powder
@ 2 white onions
@ 2 carrots
@ 2 potatoes
* 1/2 tbsp ginger
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 4 cups of water or chicken stock


Serve with:
* tsukemono
* soft-boiled egg
* rice

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

Discard the extra fat from roughly 1 lb of chicken thighs and cut into
bite-size pieces. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.

Peel and cut 2 carrots in rolling wedges (Rangiri) and cut onions in 
wedges.

Cut the potatoes into 1.5" pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to 
remove excess starch.

Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.

Heat some vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat, and saute onions
until translucent.

Add the ginger and garlic.

Add the chicken and cook until chicken changes color.

Add carrot and chicken broth or water according to the package. Bring to
a boil, skimming the scrum and fat from the surface. Simmer for 20 minutes.

If you want to add an egg, now is a good time to start cooking it.

Add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
When the potatoes are ready, add 1-2 blocks of the curry roux by sticking
them in a ladle and letting them dissolve in the broth.

Serve on rice and garnish with tsukemono.

Enjoy!
