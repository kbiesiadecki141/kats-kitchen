                         JO KOE'S MUFFINS (& MO'?)

So we're in quarantine due to a pandemic, or a "global pandemic" as the 
world likes to redundantly call it - anyways, to pass the time, everyone is
cooking and baking. I have been tagged in a wholesome recipe exchange via
2008-era chain email, and the recipes are beginning to fly in. One of the
first being Josephine's muffin recipe! <3

Some background on Josephine, or Jo Koe, for my future nostalgic old-lady
self: I met Jo in my robotics class in my junior year (of college lol) and
she's super smart, motivated, and sassy! I knew tagging her in this recipe
exchange would be a good idea, as she once invited me over to her apartment
to make *speed chocolate chip cookies* - she has perfectly optimized her
chocolate chip cookie recipe to take exactly 30 minutes (which we verified
by her insistent stopwatch). I would expect no one else to have a more 
simple, quick and yummy muffin recipe.

In Jo's words, "Happy baking!"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
* 2 cups flour
* 3 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 cup milk
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 egg

Mo' Ingredients:
* 1 cup of chopped nuts, dried fruits, chocolate, whatever you want!

Serve with:
* cold milk (don't even bother if it's less than 2% milkfat)
* hot coffee
* fresh whipped cream

------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------

Preheat oven to 400 deg.

Stir together the flour, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl.

Pour the milk, oil, and egg into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir 
until the ingredients are well-mixed with few lumps. (Kat aside: note the 
optimization of one bowl; we don't have time for a wet AND a dry bowl!)

(optional) Put somewhere between 1/2 and 1 cup of whatever you want in there.
I've done raisins, chocolate chips, and dried apples with cinnamon and they
all turned out well. Any other chopped fruit or nuts would work too. (Kat
aside: I did dark chocolate, hazelnuts, and whatever random trail mix was
in my pantry. Cinnamon seems like it would be good, too.)

Pour into a lined muffin tin and bake for 25 minutes. These bad boys will
get very domed if you put too much batter in each cup, so aim for maybe
3/4 of the way full for each cup.

Enjoy!
