                      THREE-BEER CHILI RECIPE

This is to document the pot of chili I made yesterday, and ate tonight.

There is no beer in the chili itself, but preparing it takes so long that
you can easily drink three beers in the process.  But I only drank two :) .

Neither fast nor convenient, make the day before you intend to eat!

The recipe is basically a combination of "First-Love Chili" in
  Butel, Jane; Chili Madness; Workman Publishing, New York;
     ISBN 0-89480-134-1; 1980; pp. 56-57
and "Sirloin Steak-Lover's Chili" in
  Kolpas, Norman; The Chili Cookbook; Price Stern Sloan, Los Angeles;
     ISBN 1-55788-024-7; p. 12
Plus some of my own randomness.  Both of these books are good reads, BTW.

I used a commercial hot chili powder that I really like from
  The Spice House in Chicago, IL - http://www.thespicehouse.com
Next time, though, I will probably just order pure ancho chile powder from
them to have more control over the spices.

Ingredients:
* couple tbs corn oil
* 2 1/4 lbs beef for stewing, cut in 2" chunks, I trimmed very lean
* 1 lb ground bison (or sirloin or pork would also be OK)
* 6 slices bacon, cut into small pieces (1/2"-ish)
* 1 largish red onion, chopped medium
* 1/2 small white onion, chopped medium
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* sea salt
* black pepper (salt and pepper the meat before cooking)
* 8 fresh Anaheim chiles (but this last batch only used six, was all they had)
* 4 fresh jalapeno chiles
* 2 red bell peppers
* 2 1/4 cup beef broth (I used "Better Than Bouillon" brand)
* few tbs tomato paste
* 3x14 oz cans of whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 fresh medium sized hot house tomatoes, chopped coarse
* couple tbs powdered tomatoes (also from http://www.thespicehouse.com)
* several tbs of commercial hot chili powder
  (sweet ancho chile pepper, hot red cayenne pepper,
   crushed red hot peppers, ground cumin, garlic, Mexican oregano)
* 1ish tsp hot red cayenne pepper (in addition to what was in chili powder)
* 1ish tbs oregano
* 1ish tsp ground cumin
* 1ish tsp celery salt
* 3 bay leaves
* 2 sticks cinnamon
* 7 whole cloves (ideally tie in cooking twine for removal, I did not though)

Serve with:
* shredded cheese (cheddar/jack)
* pinto beans (I just did canned, heated separately)
* decent bread (I just did a baguette) and/or hexagonal oyster crackers

Preheat oven/broiler to 400+ deg

Chop ingredients

Salt and pepper the meat

Prepare beef broth

Roast all chile peppers on a cookie sheet lined with foil
- all must be bright and smooth and firm
- consider pulling out the stems and some seeds before roasting (I did after)
- rotate the chiles as the skin blackens, ideally get all the skin black
  and blistering, but avoid keeping in so long that the fleshy part burns
- when each chile is blackened/blistered, put in a bowl with a dish towel
  over it (and I put this bowl into a larger bowl that had ice in it)
- let all chiles sit and cool
- consider wearing thin gloves when peeling, especially if you add serranos
- once able to handle temperature-wise, remove stems and whatever seeds you
  want removed, then peel the skin off each chile.  cannot skip this skin
  peeling for the Anaheims!  I suppose jalapenos and red bell peppers could
  be chopped and sauteed with the skin on, but since you gotta roast and
  peel the Anaheims, what's a few more?  the bell peppers peeled especially
  easily.  scrape the meat off the skin with a spoon as needed
- the fleshy parts of the chile go into the beef broth until ready to use
  (as well as any oils from the chiles left in the cookie sheet or
   cooling bowl!)

Brown the beef chunks in a small amount of oil, in small batches
- do this in the pot you will do the stewing in
- I used 7 quart enameled cast iron pot
- brown in multiple smaller batches, put in a separate bowl
- I rended the fat trimmed from the meat in one side of the pan,
  and removed, to get some of the flavor goodness without keep the fat

Brown the ground bison (or beef or pork), remove and put with the beef
- the bison was very lean, no grease to remove afterwards for it

Brown the bacon chunks
- next time, I'd probably do this step first

Add the onions and garlic to the bacon, cook until well translucent

Add the tomato paste at the bottom of the pan, let it cook there a minute

Add the beef broth + chiles

Add the browned meat

Add the canned tomatoes and fresh tomatoes, add a cup or so of water
used to rinse out the cans into the pot

Add the chili powder and all other spices

Bring to bubbling and then let simmer uncovered for a few hours.
I did not need to add water this time, but sometimes I do need to do so.
stir occasionally.  Any browned goodness on the bottom of the pot will
be soaked up into the chili, oh yes.

Time for bed, so I just transferred everything (but removed bay leaves
and cinnamon sticks and the one clove I could find) to a crock pot and
left on low (covered, of course) for six hours (wish I could sleep longer).
Add water if needed, but I did not need to do so either before or after
the crockpot phase.

When done with the crockpot next morning, transfer to a 4 qt enameled pot
plus a Tupperware for future meal, let cool while getting ready for work,
then stick in the fridge before leaving.

After work, throw the 4 qt onto the stove for another 30 minutes or so
of heating uncovered (or not) to heat through and get the final consistency
the way you want it.  Was no separated fat to remove after refrigeration.

Serve with cheese and bread.  Remove cloves as you find them when plating,
assuming you can find them.

Color was a deep dark brick red, meat way tender and falling apart but
still in definite chunks.  My family thought it was hot and spicy.
Tasted nice and spicy to me, but not hot.  If just cooking for myself,
I think I would add a serrano or two to the mix which ought to work well.
